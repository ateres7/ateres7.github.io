                    I began with a rough idea using a grid, referring back to my typeface, based on a grid.
                    I divided everything into sections to make it easier to code later on, deciding to split it up into divs.
                    Starting with a rough idea and knowing what I wanted, I went straight into coding.

                <h2>Final Letters</h2>
                <p>
                    After planning out all the sections, I then worked from the top down.
                    Completing the sections one at a time did mean that I had some difficulty going back to nudge some pieces to fit together better, but overall the project, other than it being a bit fidgety, was alright.
                    Eventually I completed the finishing touches, and finished linking up the sites to their proper urls, and uploaded to GitHub.
